Once this is done the whisp step will begin which is randomly timed. At the beginning of each round, a screeching sound will be played. This means that a whisp has spawned in and the timer has begun. Players will need to coordinate and check all whisp locations to find where the whisp is. Once found, shoot it with any bow. This will cause the same screeching sound to be played again and a whisp to spawn in at another location, a whisp cannot spawn at the same location. If time runs out an alarm will sound and it will restart at the beginning of the next round. Once done enough times a success sound will be played and the teleporter will have a purple glow.

\
Set the Deathray to destroy.

### Step 5:
Play Simon Says with a computer by the clocktower and at the rocket. One player should play the actual game while another protects them from the dogs that will attack. The remaining players should train to make protecting as easy as possible. The game will present four small screens each with a symbol, then those screens will be blank. The large center screen will now output one of those four symbols, the player must interact with the smaller screen that had that symbol. Then the computer will keep on showing symbols until the game is over. One of the Deathray coils will be glowing white when done right. The game needs to be completed at each computer, if the second game is failed you must do both again. Hit the green button at the back of the Deathray generator.\

Put the Vrill generator into the knight's tomb.\
\

\
Follow the Keeper until he stops and spawns in a ring. When standing in the ring a color will be present on the screen, each color corresponds to a color of one of the bows. Zombies need to be killed by that bow while the player using the bow is standing in the ring. Once enough zombies are killed the Keeper will move and a new ring will be at a new location with a new color and new bow. Repeat this for all four locations. The location at the bridge needs to have the stone slab inserted next to where the Keeper is standing.\

\
Once all four locations are done the Keeper will become solid and go into the old pyramid location.

### Step 9:
Insert the soul canister into the corner of the pyramid. Once all players are fully set up have each one place down their Ragnarok DG4s on the square panels surrounding the pyramid.

### Step 10:
The boss fight will have multiple attacks. Skeletons will spawn in and skulls will track players. When electricity starts to build up, the boss will slowly descend to the floor. Once the boss hits the floor a wipe attack will kill all players unless the players are not standing in the shadows of the pillars. While this is happening, if a player places down their Ragnarok directly below the boss the boss will become vulnerable to attacks in its glowing chest. Repeat this until a phase where a bunch of Panzers spawn in. Once killed a Max Ammo will spawn in. The boss will come back but this time Panzers will be present. Continue damaging the boss until it is dead.

### Step 11:
Interact with the panel on the pyramid and then pick up the Summoning Key.\
